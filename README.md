**Summary:**
Maternal mRNA decay is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), yet its spatial regulation has remained largely unexplored. We identify Cth1 as the first maternal RNA decay factor in zebrafish, acting independently of zygotic genome activation and regulated in a spatiotemporal manner by conserved 3′UTR cis-elements. Cas13d-mediated depletion of maternal cth1 revealed early developmental defects that could not be assessed with Cas9 mutants due to infertility from impaired gametogenesis. Mechanistically, Cth1 recognizes AU-rich elements in maternal 3′UTRs to promote deadenylation and decay; deletion of these motifs or Cth1 knockdown stabilizes both reporter and endogenous transcripts. These findings establish Cth1 as a key component of the maternal program and provide the first direct evidence that spatially regulated mRNA decay, outside the germline, contributes to early vertebrate development.
